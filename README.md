# 🏫 CampusVoice
- CampusVoice is a user-friendly web application **designed to help college students raise queries and provide feedback.**
- We understand that dealing with **college-related issues can be quite challenging**, particularly for new students who may be unfamiliar with the proper procedures for expressing their concerns or queries.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Auto-routing to appropriate departments**:

  As a fresher, students no longer need to worry about whom to approach or where to file a complaint. The system automatically routes their questions and concerns to the appropriate college departments responsible for resolving the issues.
